                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Welcome to Math and Language Synergy, where education meets innovation. Founded in 2010 by Maria R. Chenault and Yukihiro Tashiro, our institute began with this plain yet powerful vision: bridging the gap between language and mathematics education to empower learners to succeed in both.</p>
                    <p>Our founders were seasoned educators themselves, with a deep passion for languages and mathematics. On the backdrop of a rising need for an integrated approach toward learning, they envisioned that the proficiency of the English and Japanese languages, combined with sound mathematical skills, would open vistas of opportunities in the global marketplace.</p>
                    
                    <h3>A Vision of Holistic Learning</h3>
                    <p>It was initiated with a vision and strong will: that a small group of dedicated teachers could come together in pooling their energies toward the offering of a learning environment to children so that they might develop deep understandings in language and mathematics through supportive and engaging educational settings. We planned a curriculum that would include the following subjects, highlighting the connections between them and the development of skills in language proficiency and analytical thinking.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Building a Community</h3>
                    <p>Within the past years, Math and Language Synergy has developed into a lively community of learners from all occupations. Students are driven toward our services by highly individual aspirations: to master a new language, excel in math, or bring both skills together in support of academic and professional journeys.</p>
